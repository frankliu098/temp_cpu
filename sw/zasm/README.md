# ZASM

This directory contains the remains of the original ZipCPU assembler.  This
assembler has since been replaced by the GNU assembler as a part of the ZipCPU
integration into binutils.

Other than the zopcodes file remaining within this directory, these sources are
no longer used.  The zopcodes file, however, is used to support the disassembly
capability within the debugger.
