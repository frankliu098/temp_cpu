## The C++ Simulator

This simulator was written as part of the last instruction set change.

It is now pretty much abandonware.

One problem with this simulation is that it was very difficult to integrate
peripherals and interrupts into it--more difficult than it is to integrate
these things into a Verilog design tested with Verilator.  As a result,
there's not much useful here.
